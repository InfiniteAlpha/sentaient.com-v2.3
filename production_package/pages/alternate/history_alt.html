                    <h2>From Vision to Reality</h2>
                    <p>sentAIent was founded on a simple yet powerful belief: artificial intelligence should augment human capabilities, not replace them. Our journey has been guided by this principle, and every solution we've built reflects our commitment to human-centric AI implementation.</p>

                            <p class="timeline-period">Founding Years</p>
                            <p>sentAIent was born from a recognition that while AI technology was rapidly advancing, many businesses struggled to implement it effectively. Brian Leonard and Greg Francis saw an opportunity to bridge this gap by creating AI solutions designed specifically for practical business applications.</p>
                            <p>The founding vision was clear: build AI systems that work alongside humans, handling routine tasks and data analysis while empowering people to focus on strategic decisions and creative problem-solving. This philosophy would become the cornerstone of everything sentAIent does.</p>

                            <p>Our first major milestone came with the successful deployment of autonomous AI agents for small and mid-sized businesses. These early implementations validated our approach, delivering 40-60% efficiency gains while maintaining human oversight and control.</p>
                            <p>Client feedback was clear: businesses didn't just want cutting-edge technology—they wanted practical solutions that integrated with existing workflows and delivered measurable ROI. This insight shaped our product development strategy going forward.</p>

                            <p>As generative AI capabilities matured, sentAIent moved quickly to incorporate these technologies into our solution portfolio. We developed custom-trained chatbots that could speak in clients' brand voices, providing 24/7 customer support and sales assistance.</p>
                            <p>This expansion allowed us to serve a broader range of use cases, from customer service automation to marketing engagement. Our ability to customize generative AI for specific business contexts became a key differentiator in the market.</p>
